# ML Music Classification

This is the README file for the Music Classification project, which is available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/ericajstevenson/ML_music_classification.

## Project Overview

The ML Music Classification project aims to build a machine learning model for classifying music tracks into different genres. The project uses various machine learning algorithms and techniques to optimize the classification model for better accuracy and performance.

## Repository Contents

The main file of this project is the Jupyter Notebook `Classification Model Optimization.ipynb`, which contains all the code, explanations, and visualizations for the project.

### Dependencies

To run the project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the GTZAN Genre Collection, which consists of 1000 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long. The dataset is divided into 10 genres, with 100 tracks per genre.

You can download the dataset [here](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html).

## Project Steps

The project follows these steps:

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Extraction
3. Feature Scaling
4. Model Selection
5. Model Optimization
6. Model Evaluation
7. Model Deployment

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the `Classification Model Optimization.ipynb` file.
2. Download the GTZAN Genre Collection dataset and extract it into a folder named `data` in the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies.
4. Open the `Classification Model Optimization.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
5. Run the notebook cells in sequence.
